# ECS 36C â€” Data Structures & Algorithms (UC Davis)

This repository contains my implementations and practice code for **ECS 36C**, a course at UC Davis that provides a systematic study of data structures and algorithms. The course builds on object-oriented programming concepts and emphasizes efficiency, correctness, and the mathematical analysis of algorithms.

## ðŸ“˜ About ECS 36C
ECS 36C is part of the UC Davis Computer Science curriculum and focuses on:

- Abstract data types and their implementation
- Analysis of algorithmic complexity (time and space)
- Searching and sorting algorithms
- Graph algorithms (shortest paths, spanning trees, traversal, topological sort)
- Trees and balanced trees (AVL, Red-Black, B-Trees)
- Hashing and priority queues
- Union-Find and disjoint set structures

The course is designed to strengthen problem-solving skills and provide the foundation for advanced topics in algorithms, systems, and software engineering.

## ðŸ›  What This Repository Contains
This repo serves as a collection of C++ implementations of the core algorithms and data structures studied in ECS 36C. It reflects my own learning process and coding practice for the course.  

Youâ€™ll find implementations of:
- Fundamental data structures (stacks,queues,linked lists,trees,hash tables,etc.)
- Sorting algorithms
- Graph algorithms
- Balanced trees and advanced structures

Each program is written in a straightforward style to highlight the key ideas without unnecessary complexity.
